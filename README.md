# Push_swap
Project Push-Swap - Sorting integers with limited methods - Helsinki Hive (42 school) project;

Project time: ~200 hours.

Subject:  
Write a program to check valid output (checker) 
Write a program to sort list of integers using 2 stacks with least amount of moves (push_swap)

Restrictions: 

- Allowed functions: write, malloc, free.
- All sudden unsuspected terminations and/or leaks result to failing grade;  
- All code must be written according to the school 42 norm (see section norm in main page);  
- Only following stack manipulation operations can be used:
  - push top integer to the other stack, 
  - rotate or reverse rotate: a-stack or b-stack or both stacks,  
  - swap top integers of a stack: a-stack, b-stack or both stacks; 
- 500 ints must be sorted in under 5500 moves for 100% grade and under 7500 for passing grade;
  
Problems:
- Implementing algorithm to work with limited manipulation methods;  
- Extracting way to measure options for their viability (movecost);  
- Implementing optimization (all but push can be used on both stacks saving one move);  

Learned concepts: 

- Sorting methods:
  - Merge,  
  - Insert,  
  - Bubble;  
- Better understanding of linked list;  
- Better understanding of graphs;
